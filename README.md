# TOTEM ZMK Config

ZMK configuration for the 38 key [TOTEM keyboard](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM) by GEISTGEIST.

I use this layout for my work as a software engineer and casually. It is designed to impede as little as possible on quick, common
actions, such as typing and navigation (looking at you, home row mods). To this end, it uses the extra keys afforded by the TOTEM
to make certain actions easier.

## Design
The general usecase for this layout is with a window manager and terminal multiplexer.
- Super for window manager actions
- Alt for terminal multiplexer actions
- Ctrl for text editor actions

## Notable features:
- Colemak-DH
- Programmer-optimised layout
- Vim-style navigation
- Callum-style mods instead of home-row mods
- (WIP) Mouse emulation

## Building and flashing:
